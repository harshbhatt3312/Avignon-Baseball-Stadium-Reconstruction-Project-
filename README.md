# Avignon-Baseball-Stadium-Reconstruction-Project-
Managed the reconstruction of the Avignon Baseball Stadium (Budget $536M), leveraging WBS and MS Project to optimize scheduling, allocation of resources, and cost control, ensuring 100% completion ahead of schedule and within budget. 


Project Details 


The Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) is a systematic, hierarchical decomposition of a project's deliverables, tasks, and activities. The rationale behind employing the WBS framework lies in its ability to delineate major project components effectively. In this project, critical deliverables included roof construction, stadium infrastructure, seating arrangement, and baseball field development. The WBS method facilitated the segmentation of intricate elements, streamlining execution. For instance, the seating arrangement, a complex deliverable, was strategically divided into three distinct work packages:

Layout and design of seating arrangements
Seat accessories and installations
Seat quality and durability assessment
The Microsoft Project (Gantt Chart) provided a dynamic visualization of the project schedule, encompassing tasks, dependencies, and progress tracking. Its integration enabled seamless input of project attributes, initiation dates, and work breakdown structures while determining task durations and interdependencies. Various task relationships such as Finish-to-Start (FS), Finish-to-Finish (FF), and Start-to-Start (SS) were established, optimizing workflow synchronization. Moreover, MS Project facilitated constraint management, resource allocation (materials, personnel, and equipment), milestone tracking, and real-time progress monitoring, ensuring project adherence to timelines and budgets.

The G&E Company undertook the contract for reconstructing the Avignon Baseball Stadium in Toronto, with a total seating capacity of 74,000 spectators. The project, valued at $536,269,577.23 ($536 million), commenced on June 1, 2020, and concluded ahead of schedule on December 6, 2022. The allocated budget ranged from $500 million to $900 million, and the project was executed within this financial scope.

Key milestones included site assessment, acquisition of legal permits, and formwork preparation at the outset, while final inspections and certification issuance marked the project's closure. Notable expenditures included $10 million for advanced electronic installations ensuring spectator safety, $11,777,862 for roof construction, and $128 million for overall infrastructure development. Additionally, fixed costs were allocated for preliminary assessments, including environmental and hydrological evaluations ($5,000), government documentation processing ($1,000–$900), and site evaluations.

The stadium's construction spanned 649 days (July 1, 2020 – December 12, 2022), culminating in a final project expenditure of $536,301,477.23, with an insignificant variance between baseline and actual costs. The Cost Overview Report indicated a fixed cost balance of $200,000 and a variance of $31,900, affirming 100% project completion within the allocated budget. The Work Overview Report documented 80,824 labor hours, while the burndown analysis tracked work completion progress.

For stakeholder transparency, three custom reports—Resource Overview, Resource Cost Overview, and Milestone Report—were generated, offering in-depth insights into resource allocation, cost distributions, and project milestones. The project successfully adhered to predefined objectives, demonstrating optimal scheduling, resource efficiency, and cost containment.
